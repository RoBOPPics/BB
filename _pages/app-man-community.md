The Community has three tabs: Community, Profile and Activity.

The Community provides a place for users of the App to post their stories about their training experience. 

Others can "Bopp" these stories, and can also add additional insights.

The Player Profile page lists your basic information along with links to the user manuals and other resources.

The Activity page lists everything you have created or added into the app. Each entry is a link to that item, giving you an easy way to go back to a Pattern, Playlist, Story or Insight that you enjoyed.
