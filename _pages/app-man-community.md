The Community has three tabs: Community, Profile and Activity.

## Community

The Community provides a place for users of the App to post their stories about their training experience into the community feed. 

Your Stories can also contain photos and videos.

All Stories are reviewed before they will appear in the feed to others. Only positive information will be approved. 

Others can "Bopp" your stories, and they can also add their own additional "Insights". 

The feed also contains instructional and support information curated by RoBOPPics. 

Set the filter at the top of the page to display the type of information you want to see. The choices currently are: All, Support, Workout, Skills, Tactics, Strategy, Mindset and Suggestions.

## Profile

The Player Profile page lists, and lets you edit, your user information. 

It also contains links to the user agreements, user manuals and other resources.

## Activity

The Activity page lists everything you have created or played in the app. 

Each entry is a link to that item, giving you an easy way to go back to a Pattern, Playlist, Story or Insight that you created or enjoyed playing.
