## Sign up now
If this is your first time logging in, you will need to setup your account. 

Click on "Sign up now".

During beta testing, only a username and password are required. 

When the BallBOPPer starts shipping to Players, two factor authentication will be enabled. You will then need to enter a verifiable email address, and a verifiable telephone number. These are required to prevent nefarious user's of the App from hijacking your BallBOPPer.

## Login
If you already have an account, enter your email address and password.

After logging in the first time, your credentials will be remembered by the App for up to 90 days.
