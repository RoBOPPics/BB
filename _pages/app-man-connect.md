When you first launch the BallBOPPer, you will see the following screen.

After checking the box and clicking OK, you will be forwarded to the login page.

## Sign up now
If this is your first time logging in, you will need to setup your account. Click on "Sign up now".

## Login
"Log in and Connect" is for when you are on-court and ready to play.

You will need your Email address and Password.

After logging in the first time, your credentials will be remembered by the App. The only time you will ever need to reenter it again is when you change phones, or reinstall the App.
