The Catalog is similar to the Pattern and Playlist Libraries in that it has the same three tabs: Patterns, Selected Playlist, and Playlists. 

The big difference between them is that everything in the catalog is online, and not on your phone or tablet. The Catalog contains additional Patterns and Playlists that you can browse through and download.

You cannot create a new Pattern or Playlist in the Catalog. 

You create new Patterns and Playlists in your Library, and then if you want to share them with other BallBOPPer users, you can upload them to the Catalog. The menu items for doing this are found on Queueing menu for the Pattern or Playlist in their respective libraries. See the Pattern and Playlist Queueing section for additional details.

When you tap the Kabob menu on a Pattern or Playlist in the Catalog, you only have one option: Download Pattern or Download Playlist.

Tapping on this item will download the selected Pattern or Playlist into your Pattern or Playlist Library. 

You can then Queue and Play the Pattern or Playlist.

Note that you can edit the Patterns and Playlists that you download from the Catalog with the one exception that you cannot change the Attribution to the original author. 

Also if you launch the Queueing menu on an item that you downloaded from the Catalog, you will note that the "Upload to Catalog" option is missing. The original author of the item in the Catalog is the only one who can update their own items in the Catalog.
