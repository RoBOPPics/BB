## Controller

The Core Controller provides controls for the physical robot. The eight buttons at the top mirror the physical buttons on the BallBOPPer robot. Stop, Pause, Play are Self Explanatory. Select is for selcting the Drill or Pattern you wish to play. Reboot will reboot the BallBOPPer computer. Reload will start the Auto Reloader. Delay will delay the beginning of the running of a Drill or Pattern by 15 seconds each time it is pressed. Locate is used for calibrating the Location system before beginning a training session on a new court.

## Alternate Controllers

### Voice Controller using Headset

The voice controller can be used with any sweatproof bluetooth headset. It has many of the same functions as the buttons, but it is much easier to run a training session without holding your smartphone in one hand.

### Rover Manual Controller

The Rover Manual Controller is a positional controller that gives you the ability to send the BallBOPPer to a particular position on it's side of the court. Press the spot where you want it to move to, and it will travel that spot and wait.

## Correct-Drift

The Correct Drift page is specifically for correcting for windy or other conditions that are preventing the launched balls from hitting their spots. You can add or subtract distance, or adjust the shots left or right, higher or lower.

## Settings

The three Settings on this page allow you to turn three services On and Off. If you donot have the Reloader and/or Rover attached or turned ON, it is best to turn them off here. If you are using the BallBOPPer in a location that is not a tennis court, such as your driveway or backyard, then you must turn the Location Service OFF, otherwise it will not run. With the Location Service turned off, you will need to manually position and point the Robot in the right direction.
