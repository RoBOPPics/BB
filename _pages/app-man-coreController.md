## Controller

The Core Controller provides controls for the physical robot. 

When you press SELECT on any of the Patterns in a Pattern Library, the Pattern is transmitted to the robot, and the Controller pops up automatically in the App. Press PLAY and the robot will begin running the Pattern. 

The eight buttons at the top or the Controller mirror the physical buttons on the BallBOPPer robot. Stop, Pause, Play are self explanatory. Select is for selecting the Drill or Pattern you wish to play. Reboot will reboot the BallBOPPer computer. Reload will start the Ball Reloading system. Delay will delay the beginning of the running of a Drill or Pattern by 15 seconds each time it is pressed. Locate is used for calibrating the Location system before beginning a training session on a new court.

## Alternate Controllers

### Voice Controller using Headset

The voice controller can be used with any sweatproof bluetooth headset. 

It offers many of the same functions as the buttons, but you will find it much easier to run a training session without holding your smartphone in one hand.

### Rover Manual Controller

The Rover Manual Controller is a positional controller that gives you the ability to send the BallBOPPer to a particular position on it's side of the court. Press the spot where you want it to move to, and it will travel that spot and wait.

## Correct-Drift

The Correct Drift page is specifically for correcting for windy or other conditions that are preventing the launched balls from hitting their spots. 

You can add or subtract distance, adjust the shots left or right, and make them higher or lower. These settings are temporary and revert to the default settings when you turn the BallBOPPer off.

## Settings

The three Settings on this page allow you to turn three services On and Off. 

If you do not have the Ball Reloader and/or Rover attached or turned ON, it is best to turn them off here. 

If you are using the BallBOPPer in a location that is not a tennis court, such as your driveway or backyard, then you must turn the Location Service OFF, otherwise the robot will indicate an ERROR. 

With the Location Service turned off, you will need to manually position and point the Robot in the correct direction.
