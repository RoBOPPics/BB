The main screen of the BallBOPPer App is the Pattern Libraries page.

This page has three tabs across the top: Catalog, Custom and Playlist. You can tap each of these tabs to navigate to that page, or you can swipe left and right to navigate between them.

## Catalog
The Catalog lists the Drills and Patterns which come with the BallBOPPer out of the box. These Drills and Patterns cannot be edited, but they can be coped into the Custom and Playlist libraries where they can be edited.

These Patterns fall into two general types: drills and “patterns of play”.

Drills tend to be very predictable, and are for practicing particular skills in isolation, so they become second nature.

Patterns of Play are for practicing tactics and strategy. They are based on different playing styles, and are less predictable, since a big part of match play is being prepared for the unexpected.

The Drills and Patterns listed in the Catalog will change over time as users create and submit their own Drills and Patterns for inclusion. This is easily accomplished by copying a Drill or Pattern that you have created, into the Catalog. If approved for inclusion in the catalog, the Drill or Pattern will then appear in the catalog for all BallBOPPer users.
