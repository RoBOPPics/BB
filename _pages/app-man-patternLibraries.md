The main screen of the BallBOPPer App is the Pattern Libraries page.

This page has three tabs across the top: Catalog, Custom and Playlist. You can tap each of these tabs to navigate to that page, or you can swipe left and right to navigate between them.

## Catalog
The Catalog lists the Drills and Patterns which come with the BallBOPPer out of the box. This list will change over time as users create and submit their own Drills and Patterns for inclusion.

These Patterns fall into two general types: drills and “patterns of play”.

Drills tend to be very predictable, and are for practicing particular skills in isolation, so they become second nature.

Patterns of Play are for practicing tactics and strategy. They are based on different playing styles, and are less predictable, since a big part of match play is being prepared for the unexpected.
