The Patterns and Playlists section has three tabs across the top: Patterns, Selected Playlist and Playlists. You can tap each of these tabs to navigate to that page, or you can swipe left and right to navigate between them.

The BallBOPPer robot and the Pattern Library are all about creating "Patterns of Play".

Patterns of Play are for practicing tactics and strategy. They are based on different playing styles, and are less predictable than drills, since a big part of match play is being prepared for the unexpected.

For more information on Patterns of Play, see the <a href="https://roboppics.com/blogs/news">What are Patterns of Play</a> article in the News section of the RoBOPPics website.

## Pattern Library
The Pattern Library lists the Patterns that you have created, or that you have downloaded from the Pattern and Playlists Catalog. 

![Catalog Image](../assets/images/PatternLibrary_500.jpg){: width="300" .align-center } 

You can filter the list of Patterns by their Training Focus. The current choices are: All, Workout, Skills, Tactics, Strategy, and Mindset.

The Patterns are ordered according to their Rating with the highest rated Patterns at the top. The ratings here are your Ratings. As you play different Patterns, you should adjust the Ratings so your favorites appear at the top.

All Patterns in the Pattern Library are editable to suit your preferences. Tap on a Pattern and it will open in the Pattern Designer. The Pattern Designer and the Shot Designer are explained in the next two sections of this documentation.

All of the Patterns in your Pattern Library will initially be Catalog Patterns and Playlists. These are slightly different from Patterns and Playlists that you create yourself in that you cannot edit the Attribution or "Byline" field. The "Byline" will always display the Player Name and Player Team of the original author of the Pattern or Playlist.

## Pattern Kabob Menu

To play a Pattern using the BallBOPPer, tap on the kabob menu (three vertical dots).

![KabobMenu Image](../assets/images/KabobMenu001_500.jpg){: width="300" .align-center } 

The Pattern menu page will then appear with the options for the selected Pattern.

![PatternModal Image](../assets/images/PatternModal005_500.jpg){: width="300" .align-center } 

## Queue this Pattern

Queueing is the process of transmitting the Pattern to the BallBOPPer. When you tap on the item "QUEUE THIS PATTERN", the pattern is transmitted to the BallBOPPer where it is placed on the top of the Play queue - next up to be Played.

The Control page will then automatically pop up in the App, and when you click the Play button, the BallBOPPer will begin playing the Pattern.

## Copy to Selected Playlist

When you tap on the "Copy to Selected Playlist" the Pattern will be copied into the selected Playlist.

The selected Playlist is the Playlist that appears under the Selected Playlist tab in the Pattern and Playlist Libraries. There is more information on the Selected Playlist in the next section of this page.

To construct a Playlist, you first create a new empty Playlist in the Playlist Library. You then tap on it and it will then be  displayed under the Selected Playlist tab. Then go to your Pattern Library, click the Kabob menu on the Pattern you wish to add to your new Playlist, and tap "Copy to Selected Playlist". 

Repeat this process to add up to 25 Patterns to your Playlist.

## Selected Playlist

To display a Playlist in the Selected Playlist tab, you first go to the Playlist Library, and tap on the Playlist you wish to view or edit.

![Custom Image](../assets/images/SelectedPatternScreen_500.png){: width="300" .align-center } 

When a Playlist is open in the Selected Playlist, it will display all of the Patterns in the Playlist in the order in which they will be played

Tapping on a Pattern in your Selected Playlist will open it in the Pattern Designer, giving you the ability to edit that Pattern in the same way you would in the Pattern Library. See the Pattern Designer and Shot Designer sections of this documentation for more information on editing Patterns.

The Patterns in a Playlist are copies. Changes you make to them will not effect the originals in the Pattern Library.

## Playlist Library

The Playlist Library lists all of the Playlists that you have either created or downloaded from the Pattern and Playlist Catalog.

![Catalog Image](../assets/images/PlaylistScreen_500.jpg){: width="300" .align-center } 

You can filter the list of Playlists by their Training Focus. The current choices are: All, Workout, Skills, Tactics, Strategy, and Mindset.

The Playlists are ordered according to their Rating with the highest rated Playlists at the top. The ratings here are your Ratings. As you play different Playlists, you should adjust the Ratings so your favorites appear at the top.

You can create a new Playlist by tapping the title of the Playlist at the top, and hitting enter. This will open the Playlist information page where you can enter the details. When you hit the backbutton, you will see your new empty Playlist. The procedure for adding Patterns to your Playlist is described above in the "Copy to Selected Playlist" item.

## Playlist Kabob Menu

To play a Playlist using the BallBOPPer, tap on the kabob menu. 

![KabobMenu Image](../assets/images/PlaylistKabobMenu001_500.png){: width="300" .align-center } 

The Playlist Kabob Menu will appear.

![PatternModal Image](../assets/images/PlaylistModal005_500.jpg){: width="300" .align-center }

## Queue this Playlist

Queueing is the process of transmitting the Playlist to the BallBOPPer. When you tap on the "QUEUE THIS PLAYLIST", the Playlist is transmitted to the BallBOPPer where it is placed on the top of the Play queue.  

The Control page will then automatically pop up in the App, and when you click the Play button, the BallBOPPer will begin playing the Playlist.

The Queue can have a mixture of Patterns and Playlists, but the last item that was Queued is always at the top of the queue - next up to be Played. 

The Queue is also persistant across sessions. If the last thing you played on Wednesday was your favorite Playlist, then your Favorite Playlist is already queued up on Thursday. You do not need to queue it again, just press Play, either in the Controller or the Play button on the BallBOPPer itself.

## Submit Story on this Pattern (or Playlist)

This menu item appears on both the Pattern and Playlist kabob menu pages and has the same effect.

If you have played a Pattern (or Playlist) a number of times, and wish to provide information for other players, then you can write and submit a Player Story. Tapping on "Submit Story on this Pattern (or Playlist)" will bring up the Story entry form, where you can tap out your story and even add Photos or Videos of you playing this Pattern. 

After approval, these Stories will then show up in the window at the top of the Queueing page, as well as in the Community Feed to help other players decide whether they want to Download and Play the Pattern or Playlist from the Catalog.

All Stories are reviewed before they will appear in the feed to others. Only positive information will be approved.

There is more information on Player Stories in the Community section of this documentation.

## Submit Pattern (or Playlist) to Catalog

This menu item appears on both the Pattern and Playlist kabob menu pages and has the same effect.

Submitting a Pattern or Playlist to the Catalog will upload it into the online Catalog. 

After it is approved, it will then appear to all users for downloading and playing.

You can only submit a Pattern or Playlist to the Catalog that you have authored. When you open a Pattern that someone else authored, even if you have modified it, this menu item will not appear. 

The "Submit Pattern (or Playlist) to Catalog" item will continue to appear on the items that you have authored after submitting to the Catalog. This allows you to upload newer versions which will replace the original version in the Catalog.
